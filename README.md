Hello, my name is William and I am a software developer based in Taiwan. I have experience working with Excel VBA and Unity, and I am new with iOS developing.

My goal on GitHub is to contribute to open-source projects and collaborate with other developers. I am particularly interested in iOS developing right now and I am still learning the basics.

I'm also a huge fan of photography, and I love to travel.
Feel free to reach out if you want to collaborate on a project or have any questions about my work.
